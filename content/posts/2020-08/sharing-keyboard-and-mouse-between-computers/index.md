Having multiple machines is becoming more and more common for people's workflows.

For instance, when I'm [streaming](https://twitch.tv/sebthecat_com),
I like to use a Mac for coding for it's developer-friendly operating system.

However, when it comes to post-processing the graphics and audio into a 4K stream and managing scenes with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), or capturing video in 4K using my [ElGato Game Capture 4K60 S+](https://amzn.to/2EPkFVF), I'd have no chance on my little Macbook Pro.

First of all, the drivers for the [Elgato](https://amzn.to/2EPkFVF) don't even support MacOS!

So, if we accept that Windows and MacOS can play happily in the sandbox without killing eachother, how do we make it __not suck__?

By sharing a single mouse and keyoard! Let's learn how.

## Synergy

The best solution I've found is [Symless Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy).

It's a cross-platform application which supports Mac, Windows and various forms of Linux.

It costs __$39.00 USD__ for the Pro version. __$29.00 USD__ for Basic.
Honestly, get the Pro version. That's only half the price of a good keyboard 
anyway.

The Pro version provides SSL encryption, which is something you'll surely want.

If you use the basic version, anyone on your local network can essentially packet sniff your keystrokes, which means passwords may get leaked.
